/**
 * This class implements an adaptive re-fetch algorithm. This works as follows:
 * <ul>
 * <li>for pages that has changed since the last fetchTime, decrease their
 * fetchInterval by a factor of DEC_FACTOR (default value is 0.2f).</li>
 * <li>for pages that haven't changed since the last fetchTime, increase their
 * fetchInterval by a factor of INC_FACTOR (default value is 0.2f).<br>
 * If SYNC_DELTA property is true, then:
 * <ul>
 * <li>calculate a <code>delta = fetchTime - modifiedTime</code></li>
 * <li>try to synchronize with the time of change, by shifting the next
 * fetchTime by a fraction of the difference between the last modification time
 * and the last fetch time. I.e. the next fetch time will be set to
 * <code>fetchTime + fetchInterval - delta * SYNC_DELTA_RATE</code></li>
 * <li>if the adjusted fetch interval is bigger than the delta, then
 * <code>fetchInterval = delta</code>.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </li>
 * <li>the minimum value of fetchInterval may not be smaller than MIN_INTERVAL
 * (default is 1 minute).</li>
 * <li>the maximum value of fetchInterval may not be bigger than MAX_INTERVAL
 * (default is 365 days).</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * NOTE: values of DEC_FACTOR and INC_FACTOR higher than 0.4f may destabilize
 * the algorithm, so that the fetch interval either increases or decreases
 * infinitely, with little relevance to the page changes. Please use
 * {@link #main(String[])} method to test the values before applying them in a
 * production system.
