 <description>Regular expression naming plugin directory names to
  include.  Any plugin not matching this expression is excluded.
  In any case you need at least include the nutch-extensionpoints plugin. By
  default Nutch includes crawling just HTML and plain text via HTTP,
  and basic indexing and search plugins. In order to use HTTPS please enable
  protocol-httpclient, but be aware of possible intermittent problems with the
  underlying commons-httpclient library.

<!-- fetcher properties -->

<property>
  <name>fetcher.server.delay</name>
  <value>2.0</value>
  <description>The number of seconds the fetcher will delay between
   successive requests to the same server. Note that this might get
   overriden by a Crawl-Delay from a robots.txt and is used ONLY if
   fetcher.threads.per.queue is set to 1.
   </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>fetcher.server.min.delay</name>
  <value>0.0</value>
  <description>The minimum number of seconds the fetcher will delay between
  successive requests to the same server. This value is applicable ONLY
  if fetcher.threads.per.queue is greater than 1 (i.e. the host blocking
  is turned off).</description>
</property>

<property>
 <name>fetcher.max.crawl.delay</name>
 <value>30</value>
 <description>
 If the Crawl-Delay in robots.txt is set to greater than this value (in
 seconds) then the fetcher will skip this page, generating an error report.
 If set to -1 the fetcher will never skip such pages and will wait the
 amount of time retrieved from robots.txt Crawl-Delay, however long that
 might be.
 </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>fetcher.threads.fetch</name>
  <value>10</value>
  <description>The number of FetcherThreads the fetcher should use.
  This is also determines the maximum number of requests that are
  made at once (each FetcherThread handles one connection). The total
  number of threads running in distributed mode will be the number of
  fetcher threads * number of nodes as fetcher has one map task per node.
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>fetcher.threads.per.queue</name>
  <value>5</value>
  <description>This number is the maximum number of threads that
    should be allowed to access a queue at one time. Setting it to
    a value > 1 will cause the Crawl-Delay value from robots.txt to
    be ignored and the value of fetcher.server.min.delay to be used
    as a delay between successive requests to the same server instead
    of fetcher.server.delay.
   </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>fetcher.queue.mode</name>
  <value>byHost</value>
  <description>Determines how the URLs are placed into queues.
   Allowed values are 'byHost', 'byDomain' and 'byIP'.
   The value would usually correspond to that of 'partition.url.mode'.
